# floor-scale-modular-lifting-of-MET-LDPC-Codes
The GitHub repository provides an implementation of floor-scale modular lifting of MET-LDPC codes with upper bound on code distance optimization and EMD for multiple families of base circulants (2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, etc.).

This implementation is based on the latest research in the field of error correction coding, including the work by I. Vorobyev, N. Polyanskii, G. Svistunov, S. Egorov, and V. Usatyuk, "Generalization of Floor Lifting for QC-LDPC Codes: Theoretical Properties and Applications," published in the 2018 IEEE East-West Design & Test Symposium.

The implementation allows changing the circulant size of Quasi-cyclic LDPC codes without puncturing and shortening, just by operating on the largest size circulant. This approach greatly improves the modular lifting method and has theoretical proof of improvement of short cycle breaking.

The use of multiple families of base circulants is beneficial as it allows researchers and practitioners to explore various strategies for designing efficient error-correcting codes with high-performance rates.

Overall, this repository offers a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in optimizing their coding schemes to achieve better error-correction performance. With its support for multiple families of base circulants and accurate estimation of the code distance, researchers and practitioners will find this implementation valuable in exploring various strategies for designing efficient error-correcting codes with high-performance rates.
